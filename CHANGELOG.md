CHANGELOG
=========

master
------

- Added `--format` to customize the summary shown in progress loggers
- String concatenation for expression language
- Show debug details (process spawning) with `-vvv`
- Support Xdebug 3

1.0.0-alpha6
------------

- Support for PHP 8 Attributes

1.0.0-alpha5
------------

Backward compatiblity breaks:

- `--uuid` renamed to `--ref` and `tag:` prefix removed #740
- No warnings - if assertion fails within tolerance zone then it is OK
- Assertion DSL has been
  [replaced](https://phpbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assertions.html) (only applicable vs. previous alpha
  versions)

Features:

- New [Expression Lanaugage](https://phpbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/expression.html)

Improvements:

- Show difference to baseline in progress loggers.
- Highlight assertion failures.

1.0.0-alpha-4
-------------

Bug fixes:

- Numeric tags cause an error #717
- Benchmark errors cause reports to error
- Undefined console formatter `subtitle` #729
- Missing formatters not defined in correct place #727

Improvements:

- Colourful indication of success/failure/warnings when assertions are used.
- Allow multiple paths to be specified in config
- Add type restrictions to config values

1.0.0-alpha-3
-------------

Backward compatiblity breaks:

- `BenchmarkExecutorInterface#execute()` must now return an `ExecutionResults`
  object.
- `TemplateExecutor`: expect an `array` for the time measurement result instead
  of an `int`.
- Extensions use the Symfony `OptionsResolver` instead of provding an array of
  default values (which is in line with how other parts of PHPBench are
  working).
- Executors accept a single, immutable `ExecutionContext` instead of the
  mutable `SubjectMetadata` and `Iteration`
- Renamed the `microtime` executor to `remote`.
- `OutputInterface` is injected from the DI conatiner, `OutputAwareInterface`
  has been removed.

Features:

- Introduced `remote_script_remove` and `remote_script_path` options to assist
  in debugging.
- Added `local` executor - execute benchmarks with in the same process as
  PHPBench.

Improvements:

- Decorator added to improve error reporting for method executors.
- Benchmarks executed as they are found (no eager metadata loading)
- Allow direct reference to services (e.g. `--executor=debug` without need for
  a `debug` configuration).

1.0.0-alpha-2
-------------

- PHP 8.0 compatibility

1.0.0-alpha-1
-------------

Backward compatibility breaks:

- DBAL extension removed.
- PHPBench Reports extension removed.
- Removed Xdebug Trace integration
- Removed `--query` featre (only worked with DBAL, too complex).
- Removed `--context` (depreacted in favor of `--tag`).
- Removed `archive` and `delete` commands.
- Assertions now accept a single expression rather than a set of
  configuration options.
- Type hints have been added in most places - possibly causing issues with
  any extensions.
- Assets (storage, xdebug profiles) are now placed in `.phpbench`
- Services referenced via. fully qualified class names instead of strings.

Features:

- Configuration profiles
- Xdebug extension is loaded by default if extension is loaded
- Baseline: Specify baseline suite when running benchmarks and show differences in
  reports #648
- Assert against the baseline
- Show PHP version and the status of Xdebug and Opcache in the runner output
  #649
- Add `@Timeout` to enable a timeout to be specified for any given benchmark -
  @dantleech #614

Improvements

 - All assets now placed in `.phpbench` directory in CWD (instead of
   `./_storage` and `./xdebug`
 - `--tag` implicitly stores the benchmark (no need to additionally use
   `--store`)
 - Decrease benchmark overhead by rendering parameters in-template -
   @marc-mabe

Bugfixes:

 - Use `text` instead of `string` for envrionment key for DBAL storage - @flobee
 - Numeric tags are not found.
